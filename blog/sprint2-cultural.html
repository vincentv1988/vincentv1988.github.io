        <h1>Learning Agreement</h1>
          <div><h3>strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p>For myself, ive found that my biggest strength (and also limitation) lies in my nature to seek out the answer on my own. While this is benificial for me as it allows me to find the knowledge required and answer on my own, which suits my learning style, it also means that I have at times ended up not calling out my issue or asking for help in a timely way, often letting the issue take over my process for longer than needed.
            </p>
        </div>
            <div><h3>My commitment:</h3>
            <p>My commitment going forward is to be more mindful of the above state, and be aware of timing on tasks. By doing this i will be more able to call out issues when needed, or ask for assistence, to both make my task easier but also to better manage my time around workloads also</p></div>
            <div><h3>What i expect from Dev Academy and the facilitators:</h3>
            <p>My primary expectation at this stage is just honest, helpful feedback and communication. I find this to be a primary need for myself, and communication with the facilitator team is important to me so that i can keep track of how they feel i am progressing.</p>
