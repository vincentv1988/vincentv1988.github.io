        <h1>Emotional Intelligence/EQ</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>Emotional What?!</h3>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence is ones ability to be aware of their own emotions and others, and to monitor and use this information to better understand how they affect yourself and others. There are four basic elements that help make up Emotional Intelligence: Self Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management. using these, the goal is to be able to be aware of ones own emotions and manage them accordingly, be aware of others emotions, and being aware how these can affect situations and relationships and acting accordingly.
            </p>

            <h3>EQ? But what about IQ??</h3>
            <p>While IQ refers to someones intellectual intelligence and ability, EQ covers their social skills, emotions, etc. While we dont measure EQ like we do with IQ, its a similar kind of thing, just for a different type of intelligence and ability.           
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>So what?</h3>
            <p>So why does it matter? Studies have shown that people with high emotional intelligence have better mental health, job performance, better social relations, are better when self-comparing, and have better academic achievement. Not only are these positive for the individual, but also for those around them, as having a better understanding of our own emotions allows things to be discussed easily, defuse tough situations, etc.</p>
