            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h3>
            For myself, my core values are empathy, honesty, kindness, altruism open mindedness and passion. I'm a strong believer in doing things not just for the good of yourself, but for others too. While in practice this can be hard to do, its something I try and strive for in my day to day life, and put into practice whenever possible.
            Take a look at my <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/ec3f6150e2519">Myer-Briggs results</a> if youd like, I found this to be a pretty accurate portrayal of myself. The only change from my last time trying this was to change from Extrovert to Introvert, and even then its seems pretty flexible on that.

            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>

            While it is an odd example, some months ago I was driving home from my best friends house at around 11pm on a Sunday. While driving down Mount Albert Road, it seemed as though there was traffic, which I found really strange. As I approached where it ended, I noticed a duck struggling to cross the road. At this point I kept driving, but could not stop thinking about the duck. It looked like it was injured and was struggling to make it to the footpath. I decided to turn around and investigate. When I got back to where it had been, I pulled over and looked for it. I found it on the footpath, struggling to walk. It appears to have been hit by a car, and it had had its left wing and leg damaged. I began trying to find somewhere to take it, and called multiple bird sanctuaries, SPCA, etc, all of which were closed. I ended up contacting the councils animal control service, but due to it not being a native duck, they were unable to assist me. They did however let me know that there was a 24 hour vet located at the Unitec Campus in Mount Albert, which was only a short drive away. I called them and confirmed they would be able to take the duck. I spent the next 30 minutes attempting to get close to and gently catch the animal, eventually using my hoody as a make shift net. This covered its head, at which point it stopped freaking out as much and I was able to pick it up. From there I was able to take it to the Unitec campus and get it looked at. While I dont know if it survived or not, knowing that I was able to help an animal that was in a state of panic and in pain was important to me.There really wasnt much to weigh up, as to me, it felt like it was the only realistic option, to help both the sufferring of the animal and also help any potential further accidents if it got back onto the road. While the consequences of the actions for me only meant getting a bit less sleep that night, I feel that it was the best thing to do and that not doing anything would have wieghed heavily on my conscience.

            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
            For myself, I feel that one of my strengths, that is also a weakness, is my eagerness to discover results and answers on my own. This can be valuable as it allows me to create my own path in many ways, but can hinder me when I hit a roadblock with no obvious way to resolve it.<br>
            This has helped me in the past with my career devolopment, due to being able to sit down with a project and bash out the finer points and solve certain issues that others have been unable to. Its also been just as disruptive when under pressure and trying to solve a problem without wanting to call out the issue or escalate the problem to someone with more experience or knowledge in the area.<br> For me I would say this is the biggest area that I need to work on as it is a double edged sword for me in a lot of areas of education and employment.
