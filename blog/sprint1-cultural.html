            While it is an odd example, some months ago I was driving home from my best friends house at around 11pm on a Sunday. While driving down Mount Albert Road, it seemed as though there was traffic, which I found really strange. As I approached where it ended, I noticed a duck struggling to cross the road. At this point I kept driving, but could not stop thinking about the duck. It looked like it was injured and was struggling to make it to the footpath. I decided to turn around and investigate. <br><br>
            When I got back to where it had been, I pulled over and looked for it. I found it on the footpath, struggling to walk. It appears to have been hit by a car, and it had had its left wing and leg damaged. I began trying to find somewhere to take it, and called multiple bird sanctuaries, SPCA, etc, all of which were closed. I ended up contacting the councils animal control service, but due to it not being a native duck, they were unable to assist me. They did however let me know that there was a 24 hour vet located at the Unitec Campus in Mount Albert, which was only a short drive away. I called them and confirmed they would be able to take the duck. <br><br>
            I spent the next 30 minutes attempting to get close to and gently catch the animal, eventually using my hoody as a make shift net. This covered its head, at which point it stopped freaking out as much and I was able to pick it up. From there I was able to take it to the Unitec campus and get it looked at. While I dont know if it survived or not, knowing that I was able to help an animal that was in a state of panic and in pain was important to me.
            There really wasnt much to weigh up, as to me, it felt like it was the only realistic option, to help both the sufferring of the animal and also help any potential further accidents if it got back onto the road. 
            While the consequences of the actions for me only meant getting a bit less sleep that night, I feel that it was the best thing to do and that not doing anything would have wieghed heavily on my conscience.
